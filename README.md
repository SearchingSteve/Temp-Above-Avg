# Temperature Above Average

## Overview
This repository contains the work for the **Temperature Above Average** project, a simple yet practical Java program that demonstrates input handling, arithmetic operations, and control flow. The program calculates the average temperature based on user input and determines how many days had temperatures above the calculated average.

### Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to practice Java programming fundamentals while solving a real-world problem involving data input, calculations, and output.

## Instructions
The program performs the following steps:
1. Prompts the user to input the number of temperature readings (e.g., 5 days).
2. Accepts temperature values for each day as user input.
3. Calculates the average temperature from the given data.
4. Determines and outputs how many of the input temperatures are above the calculated average.



## Usage
1. **Run the Program**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the project's root directory and compile the Java file:
     ```bash
     javac src/main/java/edu/keyin/stephencrocker/TempAboveAvg.java
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     java -cp src/main/java edu.keyin.stephencrocker.TempAboveAvg
     ```

2. **Example Run**:
   ```
   Enter the number of days: 5
   Enter temperature for day 1: 22.5
   Enter temperature for day 2: 18.0
   Enter temperature for day 3: 20.0
   Enter temperature for day 4: 25.0
   Enter temperature for day 5: 21.0
   Average Temperature: 21.1
   Number of days above average temperature: 2
   ```
